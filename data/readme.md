# data instructions
delete the database and the runcounter if you're deploying a new instance.

use the configuration options in ../systematic_exclusion.py to construct the database, or provide a connection
to a predefined database.

You can prevent the database from being generated by adding in a file named "runcounter" with any integer value greater than 1,
though this might prevent other initialization tasks from running.

# todo

expand on the database maintenance
expand on the database initialization - have the process check for the existence of the database and table before attempting to generate one. ALTERNATIVELY just attempt the "CREATE" and use the error 
that the table exists as the feedback to not write the table. If that is the case  - attempt to use the existing columns instead of those defined in the configuration section.
